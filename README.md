# Zen Minesweeper

A version of minesweeper to play to relax - I had a lot of fun working out a lot of the logic functions for this application and designing all the graphics based on the original Windows Minesweeper!

Intended to be a lightweight piece of code with no dependencies that'll run in any browser.
