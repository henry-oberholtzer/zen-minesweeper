# Zen Minesweeper

A version of minesweeper to play to relax, with little punishment for mistakes

Intended to be a lightweight piece of code, I am trying to make it as unreliant on itensive as possible.

Future features, if demand exists:

- Will eventually need an alternative for CSS grid for older browsers
- Vignette effect to hint at areas above and below
